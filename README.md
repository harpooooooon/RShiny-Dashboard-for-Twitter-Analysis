# RShiny Dashboard for Twitter Usage Analysis 
Hi,

The following code produces a  RShiny Dashboard which is created with the intent to illustrate both the: 
> * tweeting habits of an individual
> * measure the user engagement generated by each tweet

The more tweets a person generates, the more clear the habits become.

The following plots are produced via the plotly library and are therefore fully interactive within any internet browser. I encourage any user of the application to tinker with a running version of the application available at:  https://nipunjeet-gujral.shinyapps.io/application/. Enjoy.

#### In the near future:
* Will be adding another tab to including sentiment analysis.
* Will be adding another tab including network analysis between individuals and their respective followers 
#### Warning(s):

 * As the code stands, importing a copy into R will not result in a functioning application, unless you can produce your own
	 > * consumer key
	 > * consumer secret value
	 > *  authentication key
	 > * authentication secret value
	 
and then insert those four key pieces of information inside the **authentication** function,  in place of the underscores,  located in the  __gitub export functions__ script.

 * Currently the Strata Analysis Tab will not run as the it incoporates an latent Dirchlet Allocation (LDA) Model that was too large to run on the free RStudio serves, wherein this application is hosted. 


* Instructions to produce the aforementioned key pieces of information are available at:
